<h2> Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jo Huang âœ¨ </h2>

<h4> ðŸŒ± Experienced Software Engineer | Active Open Source Contributor ðŸŒ± </h4>
 - Software engineer experienced in backend development, distributed computing, and cloud infrastructure<br>
 - I'm passionate about designing and building scalable, performant systems, and I enjoy working with data and the cloud!<br>
 - I have built a dozen of full-stack applications using a wide range of technologies spanning from React/TypeScript on the frontend to Java or Python on the backend<br>
 - Inspired by my past experience in data center operations, I contributed to an open source developer tool, DataDoc, that provides performance monitoring and load testing for an application<br>
 - I believe data observability and incident detection are at the core of building a robust, reliable system. A good developer tool would reduce the developer setup time to make observability more accessible to all applications<br>
 - Outside of work, you can find me rock climbing, hiking, skiing/snowboarding, or building cool techs<br>
 - Check out what Iâ€™m building right here on GitHub<br>
